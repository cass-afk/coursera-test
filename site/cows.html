		Cattle are large domesticated bovines. They are most widespread species of the genus Bos. Adult females are referred to as cows and adult males are referred to as bulls. Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat, for milk, and for hides, which are used to make leather.

		Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather.
		They are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements).
		Another product of cattle is their dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle have significant religious significance.
		Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu, are also kept as pets.
